# DevTestExample
Simple app for sorting predefined data. If you put DevTestExapmle.exe in folder with files that are provdided for test app will create output.txt with sorted data. 
Sorted data will also appear in console.

This app is created for a job interview and therefore some parts are not created to be flexible, but can be easily upgraded(such as file paths and output path).
